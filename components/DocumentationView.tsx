                    Silo Labs is our experimental playground where we develop and test powerful, standalone AI tools. These tools are designed to augment your creativity and productivity, from transforming your study habits to streamlining your professional tasks. Our goal is to push the boundaries of what a note-taking app can be.

            <Section title="How Our Tools Work">
                <p>
                    We leverage cutting-edge third-party APIs to power the intelligent features in Silo Labs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the technology behind our tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>AI Writing & Study Tools:</strong> Tools like Summarize, Rewrite, Flashcard Generation, Quiz Generation, Concept Explainer, and YouTube to Notes are all powered by the <strong>Google Gemini API</strong>. When you provide your API key, your browser communicates directly with Google's powerful language models to process your text and generate insightful content. The YouTube tool specifically uses Google Search grounding to find and process video transcripts.
                    </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>Infographic Generation:</strong> The "Notes to Infographic" tool uses Google's <strong>Imagen API</strong> to transform your text into a visual representation. This powerful text-to-image model creates a unique infographic based on the concepts in your notes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Speech-to-Text:</strong> Live transcription in the Speech-to-Text tool and the main note editor is handled by the <strong>AssemblyAI API</strong>. It provides fast and accurate real-time transcription of your voice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> High-quality, natural-sounding audio generation is powered by the <strong>ElevenLabs API</strong>. This allows you to convert any text into spoken word with a variety of voices.
                    </li>
                </ul>
